            <p class="post">Scarlett, words cannot begin to describe how in love with you i am. I was very nervous at first because i knew i was getting feelings for you that i have never felt before (why it took me so long to ask you out). As time passed i knew i was okay with feeling the way i did because i truly love and care for you. I have never once in my life thought i needed anyone else by my side because i want to be able to live the rest of my life conquering obstacles and growing alongside you. You and celeste are the people i love the most in my life and i never want to lose that feeling. </p><br>

            <p class="post">I am extremely proud of all you accomplished this past year. With eveything that has went on in your life these past few months, you have shown me how amazing of a woman you truly are. The fact you are able to manage all the thing you have on your plate along with a fulltime job and celeste tells me all i could ever need to know about how dedicated and hardworking you are. No matter the circumstances i have yet to see you falter and not do what is needed and that makes me so proud to se how you have grown since we have met.  </p><br>

            <p class="post">Scarlett, You are the most beautiful inside and out person i have ever met. From the day i had met you i would get butterflies just talking to you.You may not be able to see it cause im pretty well at hiding it but everytime you speak or just yap away to me i get very happy and enjoy every second of it. I am the complete opposite of you and don't talk much so when you tell me about things that happen in detail or just things you like it makes me feel amazing knowing you enjoy talking to me. I still crush on you just like that very first coffee date when i kept messing up math problems cause you made me nervous.</p>

            <p class="post">Now that ive told you all that let me explain why i love you so much. Theres honestly nothing i can think of that doesn't make you perfect. I love your kindness, your drive, your passions, your dedication, you always giving your all, your smile, your laugh, your scent, the way you comfort others, you always supporting me, your hugs, your courage, your honesty, how you help me become a better man, how responsible you are, how beautiful you are, you showing me true love. I can go on forever but i do only have so much room I LOVE YOU SCARLETT and want a real future with you forever.
